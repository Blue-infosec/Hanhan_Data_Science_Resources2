Experiences/Suggestions from Others

* From a data scientist (I agree with many points he said here, especially the one to get enough sleep, I also think we have to have enough good food before focusing on data science work, this is an area really needs strong focus and cost energy): https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/exclusive-ama-with-data-scientist-sebastian-raschka/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29

OTHER

* Make a wish to Data Science Santa! (I really like this idea, you just need to choose your 2017 data science learning goals and finally, they will give you a Christmas gift which is full of  relative learning resurces cater for your goals!): https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/launching-analytics-vidhya-secret-santa-kick-start-2017-with-this-gift/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29
