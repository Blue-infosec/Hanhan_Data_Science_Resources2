TREE BASED MODELS

* Tree based models in detail with R & Python example: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/04/complete-tutorial-tree-based-modeling-scratch-in-python/?utm_content=bufferade26&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer


************************************************************************

Applied Data Science in Python/R

* [R] Caret package for data imputing, feature selection, model training (I will show my experience of using caret with detailed code in Hanhan_Data_Science_Practice): https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/practical-guide-to-implement-machine-learning-with-caret-package-in-r-with-practice-problem/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29
* [Python & R] A brief classified summary of Python Scikit-Learn and R Caret: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/cheatsheet-scikit-learn-caret-package-for-python-r-respectively/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29

Statistics in Data Science

* Termology glossary for statistics in machine learning: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/glossary-of-common-statistics-and-machine-learning-terms/
* Statistics behind Boruta feature selection: https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan_Data_Science_Resources2/blob/master/boruta_statistics.pdf
* Confusing Concepts
 * Errors and Residuals: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals
 * Heteroskedasticity: led by non-constant variance in error terms. Usually, non-constant variance is caused by outliers or extreme values
 * Coefficient and p-value/t-statistics: coefficient measures the strength of the relationship of 2 variables, while p-value/t-statistics measures how strong the evidence that there is non-zero association
 * Anscombe's quartet comprises four datasets that have nearly identical simple statistical properties, yet appear very different when graphed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet


************************************************************************

Machine Learning Algorithms

* KNN with R example: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/learning-concept-knn-algorithms-programming/
 * KNN unbiased and no prior assumption, fast
 * It needs good data preprocessing such as missing data imputing, categorical to numerical
 * k normally choose the square root of total data observations

* SVM with Python example: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/10/understaing-support-vector-machine-example-code/?utm_content=buffer02b8d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer

Experiences/Suggestions from Others

* From a data scientist (I agree with many points he said here, especially the one to get enough sleep, I also think we have to have enough good food before focusing on data science work, this is an area really needs strong focus and cost energy): https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/exclusive-ama-with-data-scientist-sebastian-raschka/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29
